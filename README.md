# Blog-Application
In this application, I used the Sequelize ORM and Express to build a blog application that's connected to a SQL database. 
I used the methods that Sequelize provides to perform CRUD operations within Express routes using HTTP methods like GET and POST 
to manage the data and the database.
I also used the Sequelize CLI to initialize all the configuration code, folders and helpers needed for the application
